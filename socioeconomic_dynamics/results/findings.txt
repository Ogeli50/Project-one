Based on the analysis of socioeconomic data between 2018 and 2022, several key insights can be derived:

Percentage Changes:

The population aged 16 years and over in the labour markets increased by approximately 10.31% between the two years.

However, there was a decrease in the number of unemployed individuals by approximately 8.66%.
Median household income saw a significant increase of around 26.96%.

The percentage of individuals with earnings, Social Security, and retirement income also saw increases.

Conversely, there was a notable decrease of about 24.20% in the percentage of individuals receiving Food Stamp/SNAP benefits due to unemployment.

There is a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient â‰ˆ 0.999) between the socioeconomic factors in 2018 and 2022, indicating a consistent trend over the four-year period.
Linear Regression:

Linear regression analysis was performed for each socioeconomic factor. The analysis includes the slope, intercept, R-squared value, and p-value for each regression model, indicating the direction and strength of the relationship between the years 2018 and 2022.
Overall, the data suggests positive trends in various socioeconomic factors over the four-year period, including increases in employment, income, and social benefits utilization, alongside a decrease in unemployment. These insights can provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders involved in socioeconomic development and decision-making processes.
