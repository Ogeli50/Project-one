# Analyzing Socioeconomic Dynamics Pre and Post COVID-19

## Overview

In this analysis, I explored the socioeconomic dynamics in the United States before and after the COVID-19 pandemic using datasets from the years 2018 and 2022. The goal is to understand how various aspects of employment, income, healthcare, and other socioeconomic factors have evolved over time and how they have been influenced by the pandemic.

## Approach

### Data Collection
We gather datasets from the [U.S. Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/) for the years 2018 and 2022. These datasets contain information on employment status, commuting patterns, income and benefits, health insurance coverage, occupation and industry, class of worker, poverty level, age distribution, and other relevant socioeconomic indicators.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The datasets are cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility for analysis. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and aligning variables across both datasets.

### Comparison and Analysis
Key socioeconomic indicators between the two years are compared to identify trends, patterns, and disparities. This involves analyzing changes in employment rates, income levels, poverty rates, healthcare access, and demographic characteristics.

### Visualization and Interpretation
Visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps are created to illustrate the findings effectively. These visualizations help interpret the data and communicate insights regarding the impact of COVID-19 on various socioeconomic factors.

### Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, insights are drawn into the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for different segments of the population. Recommendations are provided for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to address the challenges and opportunities identified.

## Outcome

By conducting this analysis, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected socioeconomic dynamics in the United States. The insights gained will inform decision-making and policy formulation in the post-pandemic era.
