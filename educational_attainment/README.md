# Analyzing Socioeconomic Dynamics Pre and Post COVID-19

## Overview

In this analysis, I explored the socioeconomic dynamics in Madison County, Alabama, before and after the COVID-19 pandemic using datasets from the years 2018 and 2022. The goal is to understand how various aspects of employment, income, and other socioeconomic factors have evolved over time and how they have been influenced by the pandemic.

## Approach

### Data Collection
We gathered datasets from the [U.S. Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/) for the years 2018 and 2022. These datasets contain information on employment status, income and benefits, and other relevant socioeconomic indicators.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility for analysis. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and aligning variables across both datasets.

### Key Socioeconomic Indicators
The following socioeconomic indicators were selected for comparison:
- Population 16 years and over in the labour market
- Employed
- Unemployed
- Median household income (dollars)
- With earnings
- With Social Security
- With retirement income
- With Food Stamp/SNAP benefits in the past 12 months

### Comparison and Analysis
Key socioeconomic indicators between the two years were compared to identify trends, patterns, and disparities. This involved analyzing changes in employment rates, income levels, and benefits utilization.

### Visualization and Interpretation
Visualizations such as bar graphs and heatmaps were created to illustrate the findings effectively. These visualizations help interpret the data and communicate insights regarding the impact of COVID-19 on various socioeconomic factors.

## Findings

### Percentage Changes
Based on the analysis of socioeconomic data between 2018 and 2022, several key insights were derived:

- **Population 16 years and over in the labor markets** increased by approximately **10.31%**.
- **Number of unemployed individuals** decreased by approximately **8.66%**.
- **Median household income** saw a significant increase of around **26.96%**.
- The percentage of individuals with earnings, Social Security, and retirement income also saw increases.
- There was a notable decrease of about **24.20%** in the percentage of individuals receiving Food Stamp/SNAP benefits due to unemployment.

Overall, the data suggests positive trends in various socioeconomic factors over the four-year period, including increases in employment, income, and social benefits utilization, alongside a decrease in unemployment. These insights can provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders involved in socioeconomic development and decision-making processes.

## Outcome

By conducting this analysis, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected socioeconomic dynamics in Madison County, Alabama. The insights gained will inform decision-making and policy formulation in the post-pandemic era.
